Besides the wizards, none of them could connect to the Link.\n\nAnd this is why simple cops like me still are in demand, I thought.

Their refusal\nto die is a bad parody of the real technologies available to the filthy rich.\n\nMy current task was to find one of the rats, an unenhanced commoner, named Frank, a renegade ex-military\ncop. And why? Because some white-collar on the floor above suspected Frank had got hold of avant-garde\ntech, making it possible to emerge unseen in the Link.
